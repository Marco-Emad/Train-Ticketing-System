Project: Train Station Ticketing System using PHP/MySQLi 

About
The Train Station Ticketing System using PHP/MySQLi is a simple project that can help a certain railway company or train company to automate their ticket generation. The system has 2 types of users which is one for the railway or train company management and the other for their staff on their ticketing booth per stations station. The system also generates a daily report that lists all the daily transactions of the railway transport company or train station with its passengers. The management can manage the rates per destination from a specific station and the system will automatically fetch the price after the staff choose the passenger's desired destination and also the staff can generate multiple tickets in a single transaction in the same destination. The train company's management or the system admin users can manage all the data in this simple train station ticketing system and the staff can generate only the passenger's train tickets.
